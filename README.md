# Project CopperHead
Copperhead is a reinterpreted version of python, which is designed to fix my personal grievances.


<h1>Why Copperhead?</h1>
Copperhead is a python-based language which is fast, simple, and beginner friendly. 

similar to lua, copperhead is simple, and powerful. though copperhead is based on python, it is not designed for machine learning, or big data analysis. its made for small projects, and easy scripting. built for learners to easily transfer to python.

<h1>how does it work?</h1>
Copperhead runs on a local python-interpreter, but comes with extra packages that I find absolutley necessary for most projects.
