# Project CopperHead
Copperhead is a fork of python, which is designed to fix my personal grievances.


<h1>Why Copperhead?</h1>
Copperhead is a python-based language which is fast, simple, and beginner friendly. 

similar to lua, copperhead is simple, and powerful. being based on python, it is optomized for data structuring/manipulation, and machine learning, though is similar to python in its ability to do just about *anything*

<h1>how does it work?</h1>
Copperhead runs on a local python-interpreter, but comes with extra packages that I find absolutley necessary for most projects.
